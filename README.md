## Things that are useful in my eval.
* Multilining. <br/>
 - ~~As of now,~~ multilining does not work right now ~~is used with `++`, and can be ended with `++end`~~
* Mutli-script support <br/>
 - Support for all custom languages.
* Customization <br/>
 - It's nice to have control over what you do in ***your*** game. this is how you want it to be.
* Granting / Taking from people, not every SA can use it<br/>
 - For being as advanced as can be, this tool is more then certain that it can crash your server if not used right, this is why I have granting.
* There is preferences now!
 - You can use prefs via Blockland glass or RTB.

## Changing the way you use eval in chat?
Check out the $Pref::Server::ScriptEval::Usages variable, you can change the name of the type, Use each ID for the ID it was meant for.<br/>
> EX: `$Pref::Server::ScriptEval::Usages = "Torque:eval|@";`<br/>
Torque is the name, eval is the function, and @ is the discriminator

~~You can also change it by the preferences.~~
